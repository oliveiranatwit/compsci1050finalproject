Problem to be solved
	Our group is creating a 2D fighter game. Problems to solve include but not limited to:	
Character selection
In game stage and Heads Up Display
creating characters
Rendering animations
(optional) debug mode
Spawning hitboxes
Binding inputs and responsive
spreadsheet(json or csv) for different characters moves and attributes
(extra) AI

Inheritance: different types of moves will be an extension of the Hitbox class. The Player will also be extending Hurtbox
Abstract class: Hitbox will be an abstract class
Interface: the Player will be implementing an InputController interface
JavaFX: for ui and scene building
